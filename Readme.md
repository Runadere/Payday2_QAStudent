# Payday2_QAStudent

[Description]

[PC Payday 2] On the tutorial mission, you're warn by an NPC about civilians who won't react to you; and "hired muscle" who will. Player is given choice to sneak or eliminate "hired muscle".

[Environment]

HP Omen PC / Windows 10 Home Edition / I5 Intel Processor 7th Generation/ 250GB SSD / 8GB RAM/ Nvidia 1050GTX.

[Priority]

Medium.

[Reproduction rate]

5/5.

[Actual Result]
Character let's me walk past several times without a reaction. His alert meter starts to fills but doesn't change state unless I stand still in front of/next to him.

[Expected Result]
Either character patrols so the player has to decide to stealth or go straight for a take down, or character reacts when player is in such close proximity to them.

[Steps to Reproduce]

1. Launch Payday 2 on PC.

2. Select career from menu on the right.

3. Press start level, under progress heading.

4. Press ready on bottom right of briefing screen.

5. Follow numbered marker on screen and listen to instructions. If you see the word management above doors, you're going the right way.

6. Walk past hired muscle in black, back and forth.
